SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

# 1.1. Project Background
SpaceX revolutionized the aerospace industry with the Falcon 9's cost-efficiency, driven by its first stage's reusability.

- Falcon 9's first stage can land back on Earth after launch, ready to be reused for another mission.
- This capability significantly lowers the cost of space travel, becoming an industry game-changer.

# 1.2. Problem Statement
Use machine learning models to predict whether the first stage of a Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land, based on data collected from previous launches

# 1.3. Project Objectives
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing and understanding the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and key features related to the landing outcome.

- Data Preparation: Preprocessing the data, standardizing it, and splitting it into training and testing sets.

- Model Building: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

- Model Evaluation: Assessing the models' performance choosing the best accuracy.

- Drawing Conclusions: Summarizing the key findings and selecting the best-performing model.
